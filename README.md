# Pending Migration
This project will be hosted on [fakexale](https://github.com/fakexale), until it is stable enough.

After that point, it will be migrated to the [seriare](https://github/seriare) organization.

# Compilation
Compilation on Visual Studio Code is easy, for other editors you'll need to enter commands manually, however.

This assumes you have the tooling required installed.

## VSCode
**Build Tasks**:
Access Build Tasks with ``Ctrl+Shift+B``

To get started, simply start with the ``setup`` task, followed by ``build``.

You will now have a ``build.rbxm`` model file in your project root. Have fun.

## Other Editors
**Bash Scripts**: Bash Scripts, with parallel functionality will be provided at a later date.

This will require you to use Windows Subsystem for Linux, or using Git Bash.
