Engine3, an upcoming Roblox game framework, primarily made for my personal use. 
Primary usage involves using a tool to sync filesystem files into Roblox Studio.

Currently unfinished, with spotty support for features all around.

## Compilation
Uses ``v7.4.0-rc3`` of Rojo. Assuming you have it installed, you can type this in a terminal to compile to a ``rbxm``. Also make sure Wally Packages are setup before doing so.

```shell
rojo build -o "build.rbxm"
```
