Engine3, an upcoming Roblox game framework, primarily made for my personal use. 
Primary usage involves using a tool to sync filesystem files into Roblox Studio.

Currently unfinished, with spotty support for features all around.

## Compilation
Compilation on Visual Studio Code is easy, for other editors you'll need to enter commands manually, however.

### VSCode
**Build Tasks**
Access Build Tasks with ``Ctrl+Shift+B``

Then, if you don't have packages installed, begin with ``setup``. After that, just do ``build``.

You will now have a ``build.rbxm`` model file in your project root. Have fun.
